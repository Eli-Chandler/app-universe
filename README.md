# 🌌 App Universe

**Under construction 🚧**

App Universe is an experimental reimagining of [AppWorld](https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/appworld) - designed around flexibility and simplicity rather than a monolithic, tightly coupled architecture.

Instead of requiring all apps to live inside a single framework, **App Universe** lets you build apps however you like - as long as they expose an **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** server. This makes it dramatically easier to extend, replace, or remix components while keeping the overall system lean and modular.

* **Build freely:** Any language, any stack - just speak MCP.
* **Simpler core:** The framework itself is streamlined and easier to reason about.
* **Composable ecosystem:** Apps can evolve independently and integrate seamlessly.

🪐 Inspired by and built in the spirit of [AppWorld on GitHub](https://github.com/StonyBrookNLP/appworld).
